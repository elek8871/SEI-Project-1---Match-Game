# SEI-Project-1---Match-Game

## Game Description
##### This is intended to be a simple memory match game in which the user clicks on a tile to flip them over and tries to match the pairs. The cards will show different colors when flipped. The basic game settings will include a start game and a reset game button with 16 tiles.  Time permitting I will add graphics/images to the tiles and add options for a larger deck of tiles. I would also like to add an option to change the tiles. Allowing the user to choose from different deck styles.

##### The game will be developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with DOM manipulation.
